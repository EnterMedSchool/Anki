  "definition": "Bulging (prolapse) of one or both mitral valve leaflets into the left atrium during systole, due to degeneration of valve tissue (myxomatous change):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Often causes a characteristic **mid-systolic click** with or without a late systolic murmur, and can lead to **mitral regurgitation**:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.",
  "why_it_matters": "Common valvular disorder (~2% of people):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} and the leading cause of non-ischemic **mitral regurgitation**:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. Usually benign, but can sometimes result in severe MR with **heart failure**, arrhythmias (rarely sudden death), **infective endocarditis**, or stroke:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. A classic exam topic due to its distinctive auscultation findings (click-murmur) and associations (e.g. **Marfan** syndrome).",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Often **asymptomatic**: many cases are found incidentally during a routine exam (hearing a click/murmur) or via echocardiogram:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.",
    "Common scenario: a young **female** patient with **palpitations**, **atypical chest pain** (non-exertional), or **anxiety**; on exam she has a **mid-systolic click** followed by a late systolic murmur at the apex:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.",
    "Associated with connective tissue diseases: patients with **Marfan** or **Ehlers-Danlos** (tall, thin habitus, hyperflexible joints, maybe pectus excavatum) often have MVP due to myxomatous valve changes:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.",
    "If **severe mitral regurgitation** develops, patients can present with **dyspnea**, fatigue, or arrhythmias later in life. Exam then shows a **holosystolic murmur** (from MR) that can obscure the click:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspected MVP (hearing a click/murmur) is confirmed by **echocardiography**:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}, which shows leaflet displacement (>2 mm beyond annulus) and can quantify mitral regurgitation.",
    "Know the maneuvers: **standing/Valsalva** (↓ venous return) make the click occur earlier and murmur longer, whereas **squatting/handgrip** (↑ afterload/volume) delay the click and shorten the murmur:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. This helps distinguish MVP’s murmur from others (e.g. differentiating it from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).",
    "If the patient has **palpitations or syncope**, evaluate for arrhythmias. MVP can cause ventricular ectopic beats or arrhythmias in some patients:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20} (Holter monitoring or ECG may show PVCs, etc.).",
    "**No antibiotic prophylaxis** is needed for MVP (for dental or minor procedures) unless the patient has a history of infective endocarditis or valve repair:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}.",
    "Don’t confuse MVP’s mid-systolic click with an **aortic ejection click** (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve): the latter occurs earlier (right after S1), at the base of the heart, and does **not change with position**:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}."

  "tricks": [
    "The hallmark **mid-systolic click** is practically diagnostic of MVP:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}.",
    "MVP murmur **moves with maneuvers**: it gets longer/louder when standing, and shorter/softer when squatting (due to LV volume changes):contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}.",
    "Common in young women — historically called **Barlow syndrome**; these patients often have palpitations or anxiety but a benign prognosis:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}.",
    "Associations: think **connective tissue** – conditions like Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos often feature MVP (myxomatous valves):contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}.",
