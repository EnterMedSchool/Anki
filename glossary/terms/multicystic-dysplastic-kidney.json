  "definition": "Congenital malformation of a kidney in which multiple noncommunicating cysts replace normal renal tissue, rendering the organ nonfunctional:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.",
  "why_it_matters": "Most common cystic kidney disease in infants:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}; a key cause of a flank mass in newborns. Unilateral MCDK highlights management of a child with a single kidney, whereas bilateral MCDK causes Potter sequence (fatal), making early recognition crucial.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Often detected on **prenatal ultrasound** as a unilateral cystic kidney; if missed in utero, a newborn may present with an asymptomatic **flank mass**:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.",
    "Bilateral MCDK leads to **oligohydramnios** → **Potter sequence** (lung hypoplasia, flat facies, limb deformities; usually fatal):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.",
    "Associated urinary tract anomalies are common – e.g. contralateral **vesicoureteral reflux** or other CAKUT – so the normal kidney may show signs of reflux or obstruction:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.",
    "If one kidney is affected, the **other kidney hypertrophies** to compensate; children with unilateral MCDK generally have normal renal function due to the healthy kidney:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Confirm diagnosis with postnatal **renal ultrasound** and evaluate the **contralateral kidney** (e.g. perform a voiding cystourethrogram to check for reflux):contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.",
    "In unilateral MCDK, management is **conservative**: regular follow-up with ultrasound and blood pressure monitoring, since most dysplastic kidneys undergo spontaneous involution:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.",
    "Avoid immediate nephrectomy unless complications arise – observe unless there is problematic **hypertension**, recurrent **UTIs**, or a suspicion of malignancy in the dysplastic kidney:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.",
    "Bilateral MCDK requires **neonatal intensive care** and nephrology consultation. If any renal function is present, dialysis may be initiated as a bridge to possible transplant, though prognosis is poor."
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Ultrasound appearance is like a **“cluster of grapes”** instead of a kidney – a classic clue for MCDK (especially if unilateral). If both kidneys are replaced by “grapes,” the fetus will have Potter sequence."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Newborn with a unilateral flank mass on exam; ultrasound shows multiple non-communicating cysts in one kidney → **Multicystic dysplastic kidney (unilateral)**.",
    "Prenatal ultrasound reveals **bilateral large, cystic kidneys** with oligohydramnios; neonate is born with respiratory distress (Potter sequence) → **Bilateral MCDK (lethal)**.",
    "Prenatal ultrasound finds one kidney filled with cysts but normal amniotic fluid volume; the infant is born healthy with normal urine output → **Unilateral MCDK**, best managed with observation."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Unilateral MCDK: **observe and monitor** – periodic ultrasounds and blood pressure checks, as the cystic kidney usually regresses over time:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.",
    "No intervention is needed unless there are complications. If the dysplastic kidney causes issues (e.g. persistent hypertension or infections), **surgical nephrectomy** can be considered:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.",
    "Bilateral MCDK: primarily **supportive care** – manage respiratory failure at birth, consider dialysis; renal transplant would be the only definitive treatment if the infant survives long enough."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Bilateral MCDK → **Potter sequence** (oligohydramnios leading to pulmonary hypoplasia) – a neonatal emergency that is usually incompatible with life.",
    "In a child with known MCDK, new-onset **hypertension**, **UTI**, or abdominal pain warrants prompt evaluation – the dysplastic kidney may need removal to prevent further harm."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Suspected MCDK on prenatal ultrasound → plan postnatal **ultrasound** to confirm and check both kidneys.",
    "If confirmed MCDK: assess contralateral kidney function and do **VCUG** to rule out reflux in the healthy kidney:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.",
    "Unilateral MCDK → **routine follow-up** (renal ultrasounds, BP monitoring, renal function tests). Protect the solitary functioning kidney (avoid nephrotoxins, counsel on hydration and sports).",
    "Bilateral MCDK → immediate supportive management at birth (airway and breathing support due to lung hypoplasia). If possible, initiate dialysis and discuss **renal transplant** options."
