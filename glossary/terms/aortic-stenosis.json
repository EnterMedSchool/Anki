  "why_it_matters": "Most common valvular heart disease in developed countries (affecting ~2–3% of those >65):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Once classic symptoms (exertional angina, syncope, dyspnea) appear, **untreated AS has a poor prognosis** (~50% 5-year survival without intervention):contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. Early recognition of severe AS (e.g., harsh murmur with carotid radiation, **SAD** triad) and timely valve replacement is critical and frequently tested on exams.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Long asymptomatic period (even with severe stenosis):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}, then the classic triad of **exertional dyspnea** (heart failure), **angina**, and **syncope** develops in late stages:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.",
    "Cardiac exam: **Harsh crescendo–decrescendo systolic murmur** (mid-systolic ejection) best heard at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the carotids:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. Severe AS leads to a **slow-rising, low-amplitude carotid pulse** (pulsus parvus et tardus) and a soft or paradoxically split S2:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}; an S4 gallop is often present (LV hypertrophy).",
    "Possible complications include **heart failure** (due to LV pressure overload), **microangiopathic hemolytic anemia** (schistocytes from high-velocity jet), and angiodysplasia-related **GI bleeding** (Heyde syndrome from von Willebrand factor degradation):contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "If AS is suspected (e.g., appropriate murmur or symptoms) → obtain a **transthoracic echocardiogram** to confirm diagnosis and assess severity (valve calcification, reduced cusp mobility, pressure gradient):contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.",
    "**Severe AS** is defined by a valve area ≤1.0 cm² (normal ~3 cm²) or jet velocity ≥4 m/s or mean gradient ≥40 mm Hg:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. Avoid exercise **stress testing** if symptomatic (risk of syncope):contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.",
    "Always evaluate for concomitant **coronary artery disease** before intervention (e.g., coronary angiography with catheterization):contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. If echo findings are incongruent with symptoms, consider invasive hemodynamic assessment via cardiac cath.",
    "ECG often shows **left ventricular hypertrophy** (due to chronic pressure load) and may show conduction blocks (e.g., LBBB):contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}; chest X-ray may reveal a calcified aortic valve or post-stenotic aortic root dilation, but imaging is usually nonspecific."
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic for symptoms: think **SAD** (Syncope, Angina, Dyspnea) as the triad of severe aortic stenosis:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}.",
    "**Pulsus parvus et tardus** (weak, delayed carotid upstroke) is a classic finding specific to severe AS:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}.",
    "**Murmur maneuvers**: The AS murmur **decreases with Valsalva** (less preload) – opposite of **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**, which increases (useful in exam scenarios).",
    "Bicuspid aortic valve (younger patients) is associated with **coarctation of the aorta** and Turner syndrome (45,X), and leads to earlier stenosis than the typical degenerative form:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.",
    "Severe AS can cause an acquired von Willebrand disease (high shear stress cleaves vWF), explaining the classic association of AS with **angiodysplasia** GI bleeding (Heyde syndrome):contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}."

  "treatment": [
    "No medical therapy halts progression—definitive treatment is **aortic valve replacement (AVR)** for severe AS.:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19} Symptomatic patients with severe AS should undergo prompt valve replacement (improves survival).",
    "Choose **surgical AVR** vs. **TAVR** (transcatheter AVR) based on patient’s surgical risk, age, and anatomy. TAVR is often preferred in older or high-risk patients, while younger low-risk patients usually get surgery.",
    "Indications for AVR in asymptomatic severe AS: LVEF <50%, very high aortic velocity (≥5 m/s) or mean gradient ≥60 mm Hg, **abnormal exercise test**, or if the patient is undergoing other cardiac surgery:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}.",
    "Bridge therapy: in patients who are not immediate AVR candidates, **balloon aortic valvuloplasty** can provide temporary relief (especially in younger patients or as a bridge to TAVR):contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}, but the benefit is short-lived.",
    "Manage heart failure symptoms cautiously (gentle diuresis for pulmonary edema, avoid excessive afterload reduction):contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. Treat coexisting hypertension, but use vasodilators with caution (AS patients are preload-dependent)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Exertional **syncope** or **angina** in a patient with AS → signals critical stenosis; high risk of sudden death without intervention.",
    "Severe AS with **hypotension** or acute pulmonary edema (cardiogenic shock) – patients are extremely preload-dependent, so avoid nitrates/vasodilators; stabilize with fluids and pressors and arrange urgent valve intervention:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}.",
    "**Atrial fibrillation** onset in AS can precipitate flash pulmonary edema (loss of atrial kick) – often requires urgent cardioversion to restore hemodynamics:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Suspected AS (murmur or risk factors) → obtain transthoracic **echo** to confirm and assess severity.",
    "If **severe AS** (e.g., valve area ≤1 cm², Vmax ≥4 m/s) and patient is symptomatic or LV systolic dysfunction present → refer for **aortic valve replacement** (SAVR vs. TAVR).",
    "If severe but asymptomatic (normal EF) → conservative management (close follow-up and repeat echos); consider AVR if any high-risk features (Vmax ≥5 m/s, EF dropping <50%, positive exercise test, or planned other cardiac surgery):contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}.",
    "If mild/moderate AS → periodic monitoring with echo (e.g., every 1–2 years for moderate), manage risk factors (e.g., hypertension), and educate patient to report symptoms immediately.",
    "Acute decompensation (e.g., **flash pulmonary edema** or syncope) in known AS → stabilize hemodynamics (maintain preload, avoid hypotension) and arrange emergent valve intervention (e.g., balloon valvuloplasty as bridge to AVR)."
