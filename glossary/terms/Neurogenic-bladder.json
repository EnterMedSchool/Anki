  "definition": "Urinary bladder dysfunction caused by injury or disease of the nervous system that impairs bladder control (e.g., spinal cord or peripheral nerve damage).",
  "why_it_matters": "Untreated neurogenic bladder can lead to recurrent UTIs, hydronephrosis, and **renal failure**. It commonly occurs in patients with conditions like spina bifida or spinal cord injury, so early recognition and management are critical to protect the kidneys and improve quality of life.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Infant with **myelomeningocele** (spina bifida) having dribbling incontinence, recurrent UTIs, and hydronephrosis on ultrasound.",
    "Patient with **spinal cord injury** or **multiple sclerosis** experiencing urinary urgency, incontinence, or retention requiring catheterization.",
    "Physical exam may show a distended bladder (if retention) or signs of upper motor neuron lesion (if spastic bladder, e.g., brisk reflexes) or lower motor neuron lesion (if flaccid bladder, e.g., decreased perineal sensation)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Differentiate high-pressure vs low-pressure neurogenic bladder: **hyperreflexic (spastic)** bladder holds little urine and leaks under high pressure (risking VUR and kidney damage), whereas **areflexic (flaccid)** bladder overfills with large residual volumes (risking retention and UTI).",
    "Always measure a **post-void residual (PVR)** in patients with incontinence or retention to detect incomplete emptying.",
    "In a child with risk factors (e.g., spina bifida) or recurrent UTIs, evaluate for neurogenic bladder early (ultrasound, VCUG, urodynamics) to prevent silent kidney damage."
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "**Spina bifida** = assume neurogenic bladder (most myelomeningocele patients have it and need early bladder management).",
    "**Lesion location matters**: Spinal lesions above T12 often cause a hyperreflexic bladder (↑ tone, small capacity, DSD), while sacral (S2–S4) lesions cause an areflexic bladder (flaccid, large capacity).",
    "The combo of **clean intermittent catheterization (CIC)** plus anticholinergics is a classic regimen to protect the upper tract in high-pressure neurogenic bladder."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Newborn with **open spina bifida** + urinary dribbling → neurogenic bladder (requires catheterization to prevent renal damage).",
    "Patient with **multiple sclerosis** + sudden urinary urgency/incontinence → detrusor overactivity from neurogenic bladder."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "**Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC)** on a regular schedule to empty the bladder fully.",
    "**Anticholinergic** medications (e.g., oxybutynin) to relax an overactive bladder and lower intravesical pressures.",
    "Surgical interventions if needed: e.g., bladder **augmentation** (to increase capacity), **vesicostomy** or other urinary diversions, or sphincter procedures to improve emptying or continence."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Untreated high-pressure bladder can cause **hydronephrosis** and renal scarring – always act on new imaging changes or rising creatinine.",
    "**Autonomic dysreflexia** in a spinal cord injury patient (headache, flushing, hypertension triggered by a full bladder) is a medical emergency – immediately relieve bladder distension.",
    "Frequent febrile UTIs in a neurogenic bladder patient are warning signs – evaluate for VUR or improper catheterization."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Known risk (e.g., spina bifida) → **screen early** with renal ultrasound ± VCUG; get baseline urodynamics.",
    "If **high-pressure** (hyperreflexic) bladder on urodynamics → start CIC + anticholinergic to protect kidneys.",
    "If **low-pressure** (areflexic) bladder → ensure complete emptying (CIC) to avoid retention (± consider bethanechol).",
    "**Follow-up** regularly with renal ultrasound and renal function tests; escalate to surgical options if bladder pressures remain unsafe or incontinence is unacceptable."
