    "Acutely ill patient with bleeding from venipuncture/lines, ecchymoses, or oozing wounds.",
    "Common precipitants: **sepsis (especially gram‑negative)**, **obstetric emergencies** (placental abruption, amniotic fluid embolism, retained dead fetus), **trauma**, **malignancy** (esp. acute promyelocytic leukemia), **severe pancreatitis**, **snakebite**, **massive transfusion**.",

    "Treat the **underlying trigger** (e.g., control infection, deliver placenta, start ATRA for APL).",
    "Supportive products for bleeding: **platelets**, **FFP**, and **cryoprecipitate** (fibrinogen).",
    "If thrombosis predominates and bleeding is controlled, **heparin** can be considered case‑by‑case.",
    "Differentiate from liver disease: factor VIII is consumed in DIC (low), whereas it’s normal/high in liver failure."

  "treatment": [
    "Manage the cause (antibiotics and source control, obstetric management, treat APL with ATRA).",
    "Transfuse platelets/FFP/cryoprecipitate for active bleeding or procedures.",
