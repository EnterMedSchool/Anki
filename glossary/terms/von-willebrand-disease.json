  "why_it_matters": "Most prevalent inherited bleeding disorder; usually mild and responsive to desmopressin, but peri‑procedural planning is crucial.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Easy bruising, epistaxis, **menorrhagia**, and bleeding after dental work.",
    "Labs: normal platelet count, **prolonged bleeding time**, normal PT, and **PTT normal or mildly prolonged**."

  "problem_solving": [
    "Ristocetin aggregation test is impaired.",
    "Type 1 disease responds to **desmopressin** (endothelial release of vWF and factor VIII).",
    "Severe disease/major surgery: **vWF‑containing concentrates** ± tranexamic acid.",
    "Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs which worsen mucosal bleeding."

  "tricks": [
    "Platelet **adhesion** uses vWF–GPIb; platelet‑to‑platelet aggregation uses **GPIIb/IIIa**.",

  "exam_appearance": [
    "Teen with heavy menses and epistaxis, normal platelets, prolonged bleeding time, mild ↑PTT → von Willebrand disease.",
    "Dental extraction in mild vWD—best prophylaxis is **desmopressin**."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Type 1: **desmopressin** ± tranexamic acid for procedures.",
    "Type 2/3 or major surgery/trauma: **vWF/factor VIII concentrate**.",
    "Menorrhagia: combined hormonal contraception or LNG‑IUD; add tranexamic acid during menses if needed."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Massive bleeding unresponsive to DDAVP → give **vWF concentrate**.",
    "Avoid platelet‑inhibiting drugs (aspirin/NSAIDs)."

  "algorithm": [
    "Mucocutaneous bleeding history → CBC (platelets), PT/PTT, and ristocetin assay.",
    "If consistent with vWD → treat per severity (DDAVP vs vWF concentrate).",
    "For procedures: test DDAVP response beforehand; add antifibrinolytic for oral/ENT surgery."
