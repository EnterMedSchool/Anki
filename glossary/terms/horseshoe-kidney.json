    "definition": "Congenital fusion anomaly in which the two kidneys—most often at the **lower poles**—are joined by an **isthmus** crossing the midline. The fused unit tends to sit **low** and is **malrotated**; ascent is commonly limited by the **inferior mesenteric artery (IMA)**.",
"why\_it\_matters": "It’s the **most common renal fusion anomaly** (\~1 in 500; male ≈2:1). Many are incidental, but the abnormal orientation/ureteral course predisposes to **UPJ obstruction → hydronephrosis**, **vesicoureteral reflux**, **recurrent UTIs**, and **nephrolithiasis** (\~36% over a lifetime). Important **syndromic associations** (e.g., Turner syndrome, trisomy 18) and a **higher tumor risk** (e.g., Wilms tumor \~2×; transitional cell carcinoma \~3–4×) make it high‑yield.",
"how\_youll\_see\_it": \[
        "Incidentally on prenatal, pediatric, or adult imaging.",
        "Child with recurrent febrile UTIs or hydronephrosis; adolescent/adult with flank pain or stones.",
        "Imaging clues: low‑lying kidneys; **midline isthmus** anterior to aorta/IVC; **malrotation** with **anteriorly oriented renal pelvis** and medially directed lower poles."
    ],
"problem\_solving": \[
        "First‑line imaging: **renal/bladder ultrasound** (look for isthmus, hydronephrosis, stones).",
        "Define anatomy/complications: **CT urogram** (or MRI urography) for isthmus position, collecting system, and stones; map **variant vasculature** when surgery is planned.",
        "Obstruction? → **Diuretic renography (MAG3)** for drainage/function; **UPJ obstruction** is most common.",
        "Recurrent febrile UTIs/antenatal hydronephrosis (peds) → **VCUG** to assess **VUR**.",
        "Treat the **complication**, not the fusion: pyeloplasty for significant UPJ obstruction, standard stone pathways (URS/PCNL/ESWL with anatomy‑aware planning), UTI management ± prophylaxis. **Do not divide the isthmus** routinely."
    ],
    "tricks": \[
        "Embryology pearl: ascent gets **“stuck” under the IMA** (classically around L3–L5).",
        "**Malrotation** is expected → pelvis faces **anteriorly**, calyces often point posterior/medial.",
        "**Syndromes to remember**: **Turner (≈14–20%)**, **trisomy 18**; Down syndrome is less frequent.",
"Stones are common in adults with HSK (\~**36%**).",
