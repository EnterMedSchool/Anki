  "definition": "Bilateral fluid-filled renal cysts causing enlarged kidneys and progressive renal failure; most often autosomal dominant (adult type) with a rarer autosomal recessive (infant) form.",
  "why_it_matters": "Major inherited cause of end-stage kidney disease (~5–10% of dialysis cases):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, with extrarenal complications (e.g., berry aneurysms) that require vigilant management.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Adult form (ADPKD): Young adult (20s–40s) with **hypertension**, flank pain, hematuria; ± kidney stones or UTIs. Bilateral flank masses develop as cysts enlarge; usually a positive family history.",
    "Infantile form (ARPKD): Newborn with **Potter sequence** (oligohydramnios → lung hypoplasia) and respiratory distress at birth. Surviving infants have **massive bilateral flank masses** (huge cystic kidneys) and later **congenital hepatic fibrosis** (portal hypertension)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Suspect ADPKD (young patient with HTN or family history) → confirm with **renal ultrasound** (multiple bilateral cysts).",
    "Genetic testing is not routine; reserve for unclear cases (e.g., potential kidney donor with negative imaging).",
    "Aggressive **blood pressure control** (ACE inhibitors) and high fluid intake (low caffeine) to slow cyst growth.",
    "Manage complications: treat cyst infections (requires antibiotics penetrating cysts) and kidney stones promptly; monitor renal function.",
    "Consider **tolvaptan** (ADH V2 antagonist) for rapidly progressing ADPKD; prepare for eventual dialysis/transplant if kidneys fail."
  ],
  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **\"polycystic kidney\" has 16 letters** → **PKD1** gene on chromosome **16** (85% of ADPKD cases); **PKD2** is on chromosome **4** (2^2=4).",
    "**Dominant = adult**, **Recessive = infant** (ADPKD presents in adulthood; ARPKD in childhood)."
  ],
  "exam_appearance": [
    "Middle-aged adult with early **hypertension**, hematuria, and bilateral flank masses; family history of kidney failure or brain aneurysm → **ADPKD**.",
    "Newborn with flattened facies, pulmonary hypoplasia (Potter sequence) and huge palpable kidneys → **ARPKD**."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "No cure—focus on slowing progression: strict blood pressure control (ACE inhibitors), high fluid intake, low salt/caffeine diet.",
    "Promptly treat infections (e.g., antibiotics for cyst infection) and nephrolithiasis; consider drainage if very large cyst causing pain.",
    "**Tolvaptan** (vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist) can slow cyst growth in select ADPKD patients (slows GFR decline).",
    "Dialysis or kidney transplant when renal failure advances (often by age 50–60 in ADPKD)."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Sudden **worst headache of life** in a PKD patient → suspect ruptured berry aneurysm (**subarachnoid hemorrhage**), a neurosurgical emergency."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Suspected PKD (young hypertensive patient or +FH) → obtain renal ultrasound.",
    "If ultrasound shows multiple bilateral cysts → diagnosis confirmed. If high suspicion but ultrasound normal (especially <30y) → follow up later or genetic test if needed.",
    "Upon diagnosis, begin ACE inhibitor for BP control, encourage increased hydration; avoid nephrotoxic drugs.",
    "Monitor renal function periodically; educate patient to report signs of cyst infection (fever, flank pain).",
    "Refer to nephrology for possible tolvaptan therapy if rapidly progressing; plan for dialysis/transplant in case of ESRD."
