  "definition": "Synthetic analog of parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP 1–34). When given as once‑daily subcutaneous pulses, it activates PTH1 receptors on osteoblast lineage cells, favoring bone formation over resorption and increasing bone mineral density.",

  "why_it_matters": "An anabolic osteoporosis therapy that reduces vertebral and non‑vertebral fractures in very high‑risk patients. Shares class warnings with teriparatide and has a strict lifetime use limit.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Postmenopausal patient with severe osteoporosis or multiple fragility fractures starting a **daily SC injection**.",
    "Bone density rises quickly (first 6–12 months) compared with antiresorptive drugs.",
    "Early adverse effects: **dizziness**, **palpitations/tachycardia**, orthostatic symptoms, **transient hypercalcemia**, injection‑site reactions.",
    "Therapy duration capped at **≤ 2 years total** across all PTH‑analog use, followed by an antiresorptive to maintain gains."

  "problem_solving": [
    "Confirm adequate calcium & vitamin D before starting; check baseline **serum calcium** (avoid if hypercalcemic).",
    "Avoid in patients at increased osteosarcoma risk: **Paget disease**, prior **skeletal radiation**, **bone metastases/malignant bone tumors**, or **unexplained elevated alkaline phosphatase**.",
    "Use caution with **urolithiasis** or hypercalciuria; consider urine calcium in those with stone history.",
    "If symptomatic hypercalcemia occurs, hold drug and reassess vitamin D/calcium supplements and thiazide use.",
    "Plan for **sequential therapy**: after completing abaloparatide, start a bisphosphonate or denosumab to preserve bone density.",
    "Not used concurrently with other PTH analogs; lifetime class exposure ≤ 2 years."

    "Duration: Use for **no more than 2 years total** (class limit); then transition to an antiresorptive agent.",

    "Screen for contraindications (Paget disease, prior radiation, bone cancer). Obtain baseline calcium.",
    "Start **abaloparatide 80 mcg SC daily**; educate on timing and orthostasis.",
