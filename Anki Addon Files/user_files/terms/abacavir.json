  "why_it_matters": "Widely used NRTI backbone option. Unique risk of a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction strongly associated with HLA‑B*57:01; patients must be screened before starting therapy.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Used as part of 2‑NRTI backbone (often with lamivudine) plus an integrase inhibitor.",
    "Pre‑treatment HLA‑B*57:01 testing documented before dispensing.",
    "Hypersensitivity usually within the first 2–6 weeks: fever, malaise, GI upset (nausea, abdominal pain), ± rash, and respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough).",
    "Class effects of NRTIs: mitochondrial toxicity → lactic acidosis/steatosis (rare)."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Always verify HLA‑B*57:01 is NEGATIVE before initiating; if positive, choose another NRTI (e.g., tenofovir).",
    "If hypersensitivity is suspected: STOP abacavir immediately; symptoms typically resolve after discontinuation; NEVER re‑challenge.",
    "Consider cardiovascular risk profile—some data link abacavir exposure with higher MI risk; prefer alternatives in patients with high ASCVD risk when options exist.",
    "Hepatic metabolism (alcohol dehydrogenase/glucuronidation) → avoid in significant hepatic impairment; no renal adjustment needed."

  "tricks": [
    "Mnemonic: **ABC = Always Be Checking** HLA‑B*57:01 first.",
    "Hypersensitivity often mimics viral syndrome; presence of fever + GI ± respiratory symptoms after starting ART is a red flag.",

    "New ART start; 10 days later develops fever, nausea, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath with a diffuse rash. Best next step → **stop abacavir; never re‑challenge**.",
    "HIV patient with strong family history of early MI—choose NRTI backbone avoiding abacavir due to potential CV risk signal.",
    "Question asks which pre‑treatment test is required before ABC initiation → **HLA‑B*57:01 genotyping**."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Indication: part of combination ART for HIV‑1/2.",
    "Dosing: typically once daily in fixed‑dose combinations (e.g., with lamivudine).",
    "Monitoring: document negative HLA‑B*57:01, counsel on early hypersensitivity symptoms, monitor liver enzymes and for lactic acidosis if symptomatic."
  ],
  "red_flags": [
    "Suspected abacavir hypersensitivity → **permanent discontinuation**; re‑exposure may cause rapid, fatal reactions.",

  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Before starting ART: order HLA‑B*57:01 test.",
    "If positive → avoid abacavir; select alternative NRTI.",
    "If negative → initiate abacavir‑containing regimen with counseling about early symptoms.",
    "If fever ± GI/respiratory symptoms or rash within 2–6 weeks → stop abacavir immediately → switch regimen → document allergy; never re‑challenge."
