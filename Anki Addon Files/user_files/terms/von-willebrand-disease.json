  "why_it_matters": "Most prevalent inherited bleeding disorder; usually mild and responsive to desmopressin, but peri-procedural planning is crucial.",
  "how_youll_see_it": [
    "Easy bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia, and bleeding after dental work.",
    "Labs: normal platelet count with prolonged bleeding time; PT normal; PTT normal or mildly prolonged."
  ],
  "problem_solving": [
    "Ristocetin aggregation test is impaired.",
    "Type 1 disease responds to desmopressin (endothelial release of vWF and factor VIII).",
    "Severe disease or major surgery: vWF-containing concentrates plus or minus tranexamic acid.",
    "Avoid aspirin and NSAIDs which worsen mucosal bleeding."

  "tricks": [
    "Platelet adhesion uses vWF with GPIb; platelet-to-platelet aggregation uses GPIIb/IIIa.",

  "exam_appearance": [
    "Teen with heavy menses and epistaxis, normal platelets, prolonged bleeding time, and mild PTT elevation.",
    "Dental extraction in mild vWD; best prophylaxis is desmopressin."
  ],
  "treatment": [
    "Type 1: desmopressin plus or minus tranexamic acid for procedures.",
    "Type 2/3 or major surgery/trauma: vWF and factor VIII concentrate.",
    "Menorrhagia: combined hormonal contraception or levonorgestrel IUD; add tranexamic acid during menses if needed."

    "Massive bleeding unresponsive to desmopressin: give vWF concentrate.",
    "Avoid platelet-inhibiting drugs such as aspirin or NSAIDs."
  ],
  "algorithm": [
    "Mucocutaneous bleeding history; order CBC with platelets, PT, PTT, and ristocetin assay.",
    "If consistent with vWD, treat per severity (desmopressin vs vWF concentrate).",
    "For procedures: test desmopressin response beforehand; add antifibrinolytic for oral or ENT surgery."
